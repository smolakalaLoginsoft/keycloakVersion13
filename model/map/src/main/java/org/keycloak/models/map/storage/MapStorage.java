 * Implementation of this interface interacts with a persistence storage storing various entities, e.g. users, realms.

 *            there are only IDs and mostly primitive types / {@code String}, never references to {@code *Model} instances.
 *            See the {@code Abstract*Entity} classes in this module.
 * @param <M> Type of the {@code *Model} corresponding to the stored value, e.g. {@code UserModel}. This is used for
