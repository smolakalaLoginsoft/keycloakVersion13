Themes are used to configure the look and feel of login pages and the account management console.

Built-in themes should not be modified directly, instead a custom theme should be created. See the theme
section in the Server Developer Guide for more details.

While creating custom themes especially when overriding templates it may be useful to use the built-in templates as
a reference. These can be found within themes directory of lib/keycloak-runner.jar, which can be opened using any
standard ZIP archive tool.
